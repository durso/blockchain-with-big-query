# Blockchain with big query

We are using Google Big Query to do some on-chain analysis. You could also run a full node, but in my case I only have 500GB disk space, so I would not be able to run a node and then export it to SQL local server.

We are staring with the file balance_btc.py that returns the balance of the top wallets.
